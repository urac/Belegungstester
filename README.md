# Belegungstester

Belegungstester is a webpage that lets you try out alternative German keyboard layouts (like Dvorak) if you can touch type with QWERTZ. It will convert the characters of any given text to the keys on a QWERTZ keyboard if you were typing with an alternative layout.

Give it a try at https://urac.github.io/Belegungstester/index.html
